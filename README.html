<h1 lang='en-CA'>The wayic code of practice</h1>
<section lang='en-CA'> <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>
        Here is project wayic.code.  This project documents the body of rules known as the wayic code.
        The wayic code is a basic component of the wayic architecture, where it functions to constrain
        the wayic to its purpose.
