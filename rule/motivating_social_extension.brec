Rule of motivating social extension

    - At the earliest feasible stage of development, the wayic is to become:

        Ue. Attractive to engineers.
          \ : see `^^Ue\.` @ `^^ Remedial contraints$`
          \   @ http://reluk.ca/project/waycast/wayic/architecture.brec
            !! Obsolete form of constraint.
                - Rather the whole project is to be rebased on techical appeal, which likely entails
                  a far more detailed treatment of this constraint.
                : see `^^\+ Rebase this project on techical appeal\.$`@ ../action_plan.brec

    - Compliance with this rule will be instrumental to the purpose of the wayic.
        : re `instrumental to the purpose` see `^^ Remedial contraints$`
